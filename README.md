# FurlongFlipper
You can choose between:
    1. LENGTH
        UNIVERSAL UNIT, equivalent to 25146km or 15625mi (also used as the default everything is converted through)
        METRIC, i.e. cm, m, km
        IMPERIAL, i.e. in, ft, furlong, mi, nmi
        GALACTIC, i.e. AU, parsec (pc), mpc, gpc, radius of observable universe (~14gpc)
        LIGHT, i.e. light-sec, -min, -hour, etc
    2. TIME
        Hour is universal unit here
        jiffy, millisecond, microsecond, sec, min, hr, day, week, fortnight (2 wks), mo, yr, decade, century, millenium
    3. SPEED
        current rate (i.e. 60 mph; assumed to be 60 mi/1 hr)
        average rate (i.e. 120 mi / 2 hr simplified to 60mph)
        Because speed is ultimately just dividing a unit of
        distance over a unit of time, it should be programmed
        as such, and essentially reuse the code from those with
        the extra step of dividing them.
