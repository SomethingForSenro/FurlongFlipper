# FurlongFlipper
You can choose between:
## LENGTH
`UNIVERSAL UNIT`, equivalent to 25146km or 15625mi (also used as the default everything is converted through)`
METRIC`, i.e. cm, m, km`
IMPERIAL`, i.e. in, ft, furlong, mi, nmi`
GALACTIC`, i.e. AU, parsec (pc), mpc, gpc, radius of observable universe (~14gpc)`
LIGHT`, i.e. light-sec, -min, -hour, etc
## TIME
Hour is universal unit here
jiffy, millisecond, microsecond, sec, min, hr, day, week, fortnight (2 wks), mo, yr, decade, century, millenium
## SPEED
current rate (i.e. 60 mph; assumed to be 60 mi/1 hr)
average rate (i.e. 120 mi / 2 hr simplified to 60mph)
_Because speed is ultimately just dividing a unit of distance over a unit of time, it should be programmed as such, and essentially reuse the code from those with the extra step of dividing them._
