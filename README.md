Please only input positive numbers for now.
You can choose between:
1. LENGTH _wherein Universal Unit (below) is the mode of choice for conversion._
  - `UNIVERSAL UNIT`, equivalent to 25146km or 15625mi
  - `METRIC`
    - `cm`, or centimeter
    - `m`, or meter
    - `km`, or kilometer
  - `IMPERIAL`
    - `in`, or inch
    - `ft`, or foot
    - `furlong`, or 1/8 mi
    - `mi`, or mile
    - `nmi`, or nautical mile
2. TIME _wherein hour is the universal unit/mode of choice for conversion._
    - `MS`, or millisecond
    - `SEC`
    - `MIN`
    - `HR`
    - `DAY`
    - `WEEK`
    - `FORTNIGHT` (or 2 weeks)
    - `MONTH`
    - `YEAR`
    - `DECADE`
    - `CENTURY`
    - `MILLENIUM`
3. SPEED _wherein there are two different methods to input speed._
   - `CURRENT` (i.e. input '60' mph; assumed to be 60 mi/1 hr)
   - `AVERAGE` (i.e. input '120' mi / '2' hr, then simplify to 60mph)
_Because speed is ultimately just dividing a unit of distance over a unit of time, it should be programmed as such, and essentially reuse the code from those with the extra step of dividing them._
